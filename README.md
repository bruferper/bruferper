Hi! 👋 

I’m Bruno Fernández, from Uruguay!

I’m interested in software development specially focused on backend and infraestructure, but I do frontend also.

I’m currently learning Docker, Java with Spring Boot and Angular, to create amazing things, and English to improve my communications skills.

I'm currently working as a DBA managing PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLServer, but I'm looking oportunities to become a full time developer.

Here in GitHub I push everything that I know or learn, and I hope that it can be helpful to you! 🔥
